// An if statement can be used to have a part of code execute based on a condition being true
// the code between the closing parenthesis and "end if" will only execute if the condition
// that is the boolean expression between the parentheses is true 

// It looks as follows:
if (true)
	output("execute what is inside until end if")
	output(2 + -2)
end if
