// An input() expression is placed by the puzzle creator and will assign a variable 
// Here we assign the input value from the puzzle to the number variable called random
number limit
limit <- input()

// You are tasked with calculating the sum of numbers up until the input number
// Three output values are expected.
// 1: The sum of all even values up to the limit
output(0)
// 2: The sum of all uneven values up to the limit
output(0)
// 3: The sum of all numbers up to the limit
