// An input() expression is placed by the puzzle creator and will assign a variable 
// Here we assign the input value from the puzzle to the number variable called random
number random
random <- input()

// You are tasked with determining if the number is positive or not.
// If it is positive: You will output "positivity"
// if it is not positive: you will output "negativity"

// NOTE** you can use the IFELSE statement for this
